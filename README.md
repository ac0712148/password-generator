# Password Generator

## Description

For this project, we create an application that generates a 
random password based on user-selected criteria. The app 
runs in browser and features dynamically updated HTML and 
CSS that is powered by JavaScript.

It also features a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, where it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Files
The files used for this task are as follow:
* `index.html`
* `style.css`
* `script.js`
* `README.md`

## Details
Using CSS and HTML, we create a user interface where a 
button is pressed and the user is prompt to accept certain 
criteria for the password to be generated. Using JavaScipt, we create the logic to generate the password.

The conditions to generate the password are:
* The password must be 8 to 128 characters long

The user is then prompt to accept the types characters to use:
* Do we use NUMERIC CHARACTERS?
* Do we use LOWER CASE CHARACTERS?
* Do we use UPPER CASE CHARACTERS?
* Do we use SPECIAL CHARACTERS?

Once the password is generated, it is displayed to the screen for the user to copy and use.
